-----------------------2014/12/15 summary:
A) configuring:
lsusb
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/bus/usb/002/003
depending on the application run either of the settings:
workspace/sifi03/bin/KlmConfigure workspace/sifi03/settings/set3.xml
or:
workspace/sifi03/bin/KlmConfigure workspace/sifi03/settings/set2.xml
or simply modify for your application

Running trigger scaler tests: (from within workspace/sifi03)
bin/KlmTestTriggers4 44
the output will be in text format, which can be parsed and plotted using matlab scripts

B) calculating pedestals for ASIC 9 (0 based):
1. turn HV off,
2. from within workspace/usbInterface run:
bin/tx_onboard_pedcalc01 0 0 511 9

C) taking data
Data taking without realtime plots: 2000 events, hardware trigger, only from ASIC 9:
bin/tx_takedatarecord1 2000 1 0 2 9 1

Data taking and realtime plotting:
bin/tx_takedataplot1 2000 1 0 2 9 1
