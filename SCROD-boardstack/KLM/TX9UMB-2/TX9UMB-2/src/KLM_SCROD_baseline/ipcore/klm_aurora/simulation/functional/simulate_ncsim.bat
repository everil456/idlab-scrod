REM  SIMULATE_NCSIM.BAT
REM 
REM 
REM  Description: A .bat file to run a simulation using the klm_aurora_example_design module, 
REM               an example design which instantiates klm_aurora.
REM 
REM               Ensure the follwoing:
REM               The library paths for UNISIMS_VER, SIMPRIMS_VER, XILINXCORELIB_VER,
REM               UNISIM, SIMPRIM, XILINXCORELIB are set correctly in the cds.lib and 
REM               hdl.var files.
REM               Variables LMC_HOME and XILINX are set 
REM               Define the mapping for the work library in cds.lib file. 
REM               DEFINE work ./work
