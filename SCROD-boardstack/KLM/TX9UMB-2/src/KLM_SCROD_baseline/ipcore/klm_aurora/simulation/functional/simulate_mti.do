## SIMULATE_MTI.DO
##
##
## Description: A .do file to run a simulation using the klm_aurora_example_design module, 
##              an example design which instantiates klm_aurora.
##
##              The file modelsim.ini should be set correctly to map the logical
##              library names (such as  unisim, unisims_ver, simprim, simrprims_ver 
##              etc.) to the corresponding physical directories where the precompiled 
##              Xilinx libraries are located. 
##
