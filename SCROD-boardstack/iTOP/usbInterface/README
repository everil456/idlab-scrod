Installing USB interface (Linux only)

1) Install libusb:
Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
Alternatively: 
-download stable version of libusb-1.0.x from http://www.libusb.org/ (currently libusb-1.0.9)
-follow installation instructions

2) Install ROOT:
-see http://root.cern.ch/ (tested with 5.34/03)

3) Compile code:
-go to usbInterface directory: cd usbInterface/
-compile: make

Using USB interface

1) Attach USB cable before powering on frontend boards
-USB interface only tested with local clock, distributed FTSW clock should work but not tested
2) Program FPGA (tested with bit file scrod_top_10_09_2013.bit included in directory)
3) Initialize frontend + ASICs: ./bin/irs3BControl_initialize
4) Try taking data: ./bin/irs3BControl_takeData
-hardcode to route calibration input to ASIC row 0 col 2 ch 2, does software triggered forced readouts on this channel
-this should display sampled waveforms one at a time
