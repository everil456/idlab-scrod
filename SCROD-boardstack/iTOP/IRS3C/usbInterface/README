Installing USB interface (Linux only)

1) Install libusb:
Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
Alternatively: 
-download stable version of libusb-1.0.x from http://www.libusb.org/ (currently libusb-1.0.9)
-follow installation instructions

2) Install ROOT:
-see http://root.cern.ch/ (tested with 5.34/03)

3) Compile code:
-go to usbInterface directory: cd usbInterface/
-compile: make

Using USB interface:

1) Attach USB cable before powering on frontend boards
-USB interface only tested with local clock, distributed FTSW clock should work but not tested

2) Check that the Cypress USB interface controller is detected:
-use lsusb to get a list of USB devices, should return: Bus ### Device ###: ID 04b4:1004 Cypress Semiconductor Corp.
-if Cypress device is not found try power cycling the board
-if Cypress firmware is not "04b4:1004", check that fw.hex file is present then reprogram firmware: 
Command: ./load_cypress_firmware
-alternatively, program the eeprom following the instructions here:

Software: http://www.triplespark.net/elec/periph/USB-FX2/eeprom/fxload-full-2008_10_13-ww3.tar.gz
Command: fxload -D /dev/bus/usb/002/016 -I fw.hex -c 0x01 -s Vend_Ax.hex -t fx2

3) Program FPGA (tested with bit file scrod_top_intermediatedIRS3C_20140401.bit included in top directory)

4) Initialize frontend + ASICs: ./bin/irs3BControl_initialize

5) Try reading a generial i/o register #0: ./bin/irs3BControl_readReg 0
-if there is a "Permission denied." error, give the USB interface the required permissions eg: sudo chmod a+rw /dev/bus/usb/<bus #>/<device #>

5) Try taking data: ./bin/irs3BControl_takeData
-hardcode to route calibration input to ASIC row 0 col 2 ch 2, does software triggered forced readouts on this channel
-this should display sampled waveforms one at a time
